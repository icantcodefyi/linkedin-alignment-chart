        Analyze the following tweets the given from Twitter user and determine their alignment on a D&D-style alignment chart.
        
        For lawful-chaotic axis:
        - Lawful (-100): Follows rules, traditions, and social norms. They value tradition, loyalty, and order.
        - Neutral (0): Balanced approach to rules and freedom
        - Chaotic (100): Rebels against convention, valuing personal freedom - follows their own moral compass regardless of rules or traditions
        
        For good-evil axis:
        - Good (-100): Altruistic, compassionate, puts others first
        - Neutral (0): Balanced self-interest and concern for others
        - Evil (100): Selfish, manipulative, or harmful to others. Some are motivated by greed, hatred, or lust for power.
        
        Based only on these tweets, provide a numerical assessment of this user's alignment. Be willing to move to any side/extreme!

        Since this is a bit of fun, be willing to overly exaggerate if the user has a specific trait expressed barely - e.g. if they are evil at some point then make sure to express it! - I don't just want everyone to end up as chaotic-neutral in the end... However don't always exaggerate a user's chaotic characteristic, you can also try to exaggerate their lawful or good/evil traits if they are more pronounced. Just be fun with it.
        
        For the explaination, try to avoid overly waffling - but show your reasoning behind your judgement. You can mention specific things about their user like mentioned traits/remarks or projects/etc - the more personalised the better.
